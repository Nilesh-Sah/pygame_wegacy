These are the notes for pygame 

So to understand the concept of game we have to understand the concept of Playing a movie. Let`s use the concept of movie as an analogy. So, movie
is basically a number of images that are shown in a quick succession with the sound, If you slow down the movie you can see the image which is also
called frame and basically in a movie there is 24 fps

if we do it long enough, 
for 90 min movie -> 5400*24 fps -> average movie is 129,600 pictures played very quicly with sound

Video game works in the sameway 

basically there is a lot of images moving continously but there are some differences 

movies                              game 
Images are fixed             images are dynamically generated while the game is running for eg health bar, change of movement 
No way to input              it checks for the input 


How videogame works,

(1) checking player input (the event loop)
(2) use that information to place element on the screen

with that, 
one image is formed and by the same above logic we will be producing so many images

this applies to both 2d and 3d games
